## The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for the site depending on their device's screen size.
- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page.

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup.
- CSS custom properties.
- Flexbox (I did not use Grid).
- Mobile-first workflow.

### What I learned

I learned that making a full page takes more time than I expected, but with the layout in sight, it can be done easily.

One of the things that perplexed me the most was that, in the _desktop view_ of the Chrome browser for Android, the texts on the page increased in size for no apparent reason, after trying things without achieving results, I resort to StackOverflow and find the solution:

```css
.text-container {
  max-height: 999999px; /* Fix the issue in Chrome Mobile with desktop view */
}
```

### Continued development

Something I want to improve soon is my CSS layout speed, and the ability to create correct class names.
